# OTUS AI Solutions Architect

This repository documents my educational journey through **OTUS courses** focused on **AI Solutions Architecture**.

It contains lecture materials, notes, homework, and architectural artifacts created while studying the full lifecycle of AI system design — from business requirements and presales to production deployment, governance, and scalability.

## What this repository covers

- AI project presales, requirements analysis, and estimation
- High-level and low-level architecture design (C4 Model, ADR)
- RAG systems, AI agents, and multi-agent architectures
- Data architecture, integrations, and AI-specific security
- Quality assurance, testing, and observability for AI systems
- Infrastructure sizing, cloud & on-prem deployments, MLOps
- CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and deployment strategies
- High-load, low-latency, multi-tenant, and hybrid architectures
- FinOps, governance, ethical AI, and architectural decision-making

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to consolidate knowledge, practical exercises, and architectural thinking gained during the OTUS **AI Architect** program, and to serve as a personal knowledge base and reference for real-world AI solution design.
